 Reducing lag from graphics in java:
 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980185/how-to-reduce-lag-in-my-java-2d-platformer
 
 Heavily borrowed from Michael Birken's "gametemplate" example for ShootySnake:
    -used his architecture to separate the game model from the Graphics
    -his method of separating out initilization steps into methods
    -extensively used the final keyword to define attributes permanently in the class definition
    -his overloaded processKeyEvent to obtain simultaneous keypresses in an extended JFrame
    -his example also demonstrated how to draw Graphics to an image and put that in the JFrame and also how to bounce circular objects inside of a box and how to move an object using keypresses (via the processKeyEvent method)
    -probably most importantly- my original reason for looking at this example, is that it showed a looping method (executeGameLoop) that kept the game model up to date without running the Graphics side of things every frame.
