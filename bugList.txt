1. Main menu of games closes when pong game closes.
2. Pong title remains Pong3d1pControl.java instead of interesting title
3. PongTest can be run while playing game and therefore fail using game's information
4. Delay opening up pong
5. Paddle can move during the "reset freeze" and will be reflected once new match begins
6. If paddle never moves in beginning of a game, ball will go back and forth forever
7. Pong game background does not resize/ not scalable 
8. To move pong, CapsLock must be off
9. ShootySnake: Shooting balls offscreen can cause them not to appear making the game unwinnable.
10. ShootySnake: Changing resolutions can sometimes change the spacing of the following balls, making the speeds different.
11. ShootySnake: Sometimes balls will speed ahead for a split second before slowing down- need better velocity limiters.
12. ShootySnake: Game logic still runs in background when ShootySnake screen closed before the end of a game.
13. Pong test throws out of bounds exception errors on windows during initial condition when testing if ball returns to bounds
14. Pong game has a little bit of black edge on the side
15. Pong test can be ran and stop the game in the middle of it.
16. Pong x axis edges extend beyond the screen, I like the aesthetic, but can still be viewed as a bug
